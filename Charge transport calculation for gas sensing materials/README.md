Li S., Zhang L. Accurate first-principles simulation for the response of 2D chemiresistive gas sensors[J]. _npj Comput. Mater._, 2024, 10: 138.

2.The method proposed in the above paper can be used to calculate the following charge transport properties:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) The carrier concentration of material at any gas concentration;
(2) The carrier mobility of material at any gas concentration;
(3) The conductivity of material at any gas concentration.
