Tips:
1. A detailed introduction and examples of dielectric properties calculation using VASP is available on its official Website: 
https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Dielectric_properties_of_SiC
2. The most convenient way to determine the Born effective charges, dielectric-, piezoelectric tensors is by means of density functional perturbation theory (LEPSILON = .TRUE.);
3. The results of the calculation of static dielectric properties by means of LEPSILON = .TRUE. tend to converge more rapidly w.r.t. k-point sampling with LPEAD = .TRUE.;
4. N.B. Please note that LPEAD = .TRUE. is not supported for metallic systems;

Steps:
1. Cell relaxation;
2. SCF calculation.
A example is shown here:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python
from ase import Atoms, Atom
from ase.calculators.vasp import Vasp
from ase.io import read,write
p=read('POSCAR.vcrleaxed')
calc = Vasp(encut = 520,
            prec = 'accurate',
            xc='pbe',
            kpts=[16,16,1],
            gamma = True,
            sigma = 0.01,
            ediff = 1.00e-08,
            ismear = 0,
            lepsilon = True, ### to get the Born effective charges and the macroscopic dielectric tensor
)
calc.calculation_required = lambda x, y: True
p.set_calculator(calc)
pe=p.get_potential_energy()
write('fin.traj',p)
print ("Energy = "+str(pe))
```
