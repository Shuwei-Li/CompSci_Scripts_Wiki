Active Learning for Phase Transition of PbCdSe
==============================================

1. This work is a collaboration between experimental and computational efforts, with the experimental part completed by Dr. Geng at Wayne State University, USA, and the theoretical calculations carried out by myselfï¼Œmore informations can be found in the follow paper, :
