1. A latest production release can be found at this Website: 
https://www.abinit.org/packages, and corresponding installation can also be found at this website;

2. Now, the detailed step for installing Abinit(V9.10.3) are shown below:
      1)  "tar -xvf abinit-9.10.3.tar.gz"
      2)  "cd abinit-9.10.3"
      3)  "./configure", and an error will occur as:
'Your environment does not provide mandatory libraries'
      4)  "cd fallbacks";
      5)  "./build-abinit-fallbacks.sh";
      6)  after carrying out the command 5, there will are some lines about the llinks of libraries on your terminal, like that:
'The fallbacks are now ready to use.
You can link these fallbacks with Abinit by copying the following options to your ac9 file.

with_libxc=/home/lisw/Soft/abinit-9.10.3/fallbacks/install_fb/intel/19.1/libxc/6.0.0

with_hdf5=/home/lisw/Soft/abinit-9.10.3/fallbacks/install_fb/intel/19.1/hdf5/1.10.8

with_netcdf=/home/lisw/Soft/abinit-9.10.3/fallbacks/install_fb/intel/19.1/netcdf4/4.9.0

with_netcdf_fortran=/home/lisw/Soft/abinit-9.10.3/fallbacks/install_fb/intel/19.1/netcdf4_fortran/4.6.0'
      7) so, we need to go back upward folder, and make the hostname.ac9 file, and copy these links in hostname.ac9 file;
      8)  "cd .."
      9)  "vi master.ac9"
      10)  copy these links in "master.ac9" file
      11) "./configure"
      12) "make"
      13) "mkdir build"
      14) "make install prefix=/home/lisw/Soft/abinit-9.10.3/buildâ€œ
