1. The commands for installing all released QE and EPW can be found at this Website:
https://docs.epw-code.org/doc/DownloadAndInstall.html#

2.  For example, we can download and install QE(V7.2) and EPW(V6.0) as introducing below: 
    1). Download EPW v6.0alpha with QE
    2). Unpack and configure Quantum-ESPRESSO. This can be done by copy/pasting the following lines:
        tar xvfz q-e-epw6alpha.tar.gz && cd q-e && ./configure --enable-openmp --with-hdf5=${HDF5_DIR}
    3). Compile EPW (this will also compile pwscf, phonon, and wannier90):
        make epw
